# Q_SchrodingerPoisson1D_demo
Schrodinger-Poisson solver in 1D demonstrator

This code solves the Schrodinger-Poisson equation in semiconductor heterostructures.
In order to be educatif, few approximations are made:

-> the mass=meff is supposed constant all over the structure. Therefore, it must be set at the value of the quantum well.

-> the non-parabolicity is NOT taken into account

As an input, the program only needs a set of layer with thickness, conduction band offset and doping.

Enjoy! If you like it, don t forget the star!
